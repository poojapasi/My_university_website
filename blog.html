        <p>the process of earning an official document, or the act 
        of providing an official document, as proof that something
        has happened or been done: He earned certification to fly 
        single-engine aircraft.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are many types of professional certifications. Some 
        well-known examples include: NCLEX-RN : A license offered by 
        a state's Board of Nursing that certifies registered nurses 
        and nurse practitioners. CompTIA A+ : This certification is
        awarded to accomplished information technology professionals</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most certifications expire after a certain period of time
         and have to be maintained with further education and/or testing.
         Qualifications show that a person has reached a certain standard 
         in a programme of study.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Certification is the provision by an independent body of written
         assurance (a certificate) that the product, service or system in 
         question meets specific requirements.[1] It is the formal attestation
         or confirmation of certain characteristics of an object, person, or
         organization. This confirmation is often, but not always, provided by
         some form of external review, education, assessment, or audit. 
         Accreditation is a specific organization's process of certification.
         According to the U.S. National Council on Measurement in Education, 
         a certification test is a credentialing test used to determine whether 
         individuals are knowledgeable enough in a given occupational area to be
         labeled "competent to practice" in that area.</p>
         <br>
         <p>One of the most common types of certification in modern society is 
        professional certification, where a person is certified as being able 
        to competently complete a job or task, usually by the passing of an 
        examination and/or the completion of a program of study. Some professional 
        certifications also require that one obtain work experience in a related 
        field before the certification can be awarded. Some professional certifications
        are valid for a lifetime upon completing all certification requirements. 
        Others expire after a certain period of time and have to be maintained with
        further education and/or testing.</p>
